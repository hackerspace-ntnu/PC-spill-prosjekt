The game is thought to classifie as a Metroidvania, inspired by titles such as Ori and the Blind Forest, Celeste, and Hollow Knight. The story embodies a player who needs to fix his own game after it was corrupted by a virus. The player dives into his own world, tackeling glitchy enemies and puzzles, all while trying to restore the balance of the game. As a player, you have have access to both normal abilities, and glitched versions of those abilities to reach your goals.

The game is developed in Unity, as this opens for a developer friendly environment with all the useful functionality one could wish for. Animations are made mainly in Spine 2D. Sound is developed using Reaper and Wwise.
